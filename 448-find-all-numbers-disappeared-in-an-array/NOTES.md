* tried to go down sorting path similar to the suboptimal approach in missing numbers.. didn't work
* **brute force**
* use hashmap to store all array values and the numbers in the given [1, n] range aren't in the hashmap are part of the disappeared numbers list
* **using a set here is better since we don't care about duplicate values**
​
* **Optimal solution**
* notice mapping... all numbers in array are in range [1, n] & array indices are [0, n -1]
